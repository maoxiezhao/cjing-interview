## 条件变量和信号量的区别

Conditional variable is essentially a wait-queue, that supports blocking-wait and wakeup operations, i.e. you can put a thread into the wait-queue and set its state to BLOCK, and get a thread out from it and set its state to READY.  
  
Note that to use a conditional variable, two other elements are needed:    
* a condition (typically implemented by checking a flag or a counter)
* a mutex that protects the condition

The protocol then becomes:  
* acquire mutex
* check condition
* block and release mutex if condition is true, else release mutex
****
Semaphore is essentially a counter + a mutex + a wait queue. And it can be used as it is without external dependencies. You can use it either as a mutex or as a conditional variable.  

Therefore, semaphore can be treated as a more sophisticated structure than conditional variable, while the latter is more lightweight and flexible.
